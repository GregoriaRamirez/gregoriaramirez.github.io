# üìù Self-Assessment

## üéì Program Reflection

I am proud to be completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. Over the course of the program, 
I have grown from writing basic code into a developer capable of creating secure, modular, full-stack applications.Through hands-on projects, I gained experience working with databases, APIs, and user interfaces, applying real-world development practices every step of the way.

## üéØ Course Outcomes and How I Met Them

**1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.**

Although I worked independently on my Capstone, I followed professional collaboration standards by organizing my code into clear, modular folders 
and documenting my enhancements in a way that allows others to easily understand, review, and build upon the work. My project could be shared with
technical and non-technical audiences alike, supporting team decision-making and future development.

---

**2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.**

I created a complete project narrative, a structured enhancement walkthrough, and a recorded code review video. My README files, `.md` pages, and 
inline comments are written clearly for both developers and stakeholders. I also used visual charts, screenshots, and well-labeled filters to ensure 
the user interface communicates data effectively.

---

**3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.**

I improved filtering logic by implementing condition-based control flows, modularizing the logic, and using vectorized operations in pandas. These
choices improved performance and usability while balancing complexity and maintainability. I also evaluated which data structures (e.g., dictionaries, dataframes) worked best for efficiency.

---

**4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.**

I used VS Code, MongoDB Compass, Dash, and `.env` environment variable handling to align with modern industry workflows. I refactored my application
using the MVC pattern and applied best practices for dependency management, error handling, and secure data access. These skills are directly transferable 
to real-world software development.

---

**5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.**

I removed hardcoded credentials and implemented secure environment variables using `python-dotenv`. I also added database error handling and ensured 
connections are properly opened and closed to prevent resource leaks. These actions reflect a secure, defensive coding mindset and help protect 
sensitive data within the application.

## üîÑ Personal Growth

Working independently on my Capstone project taught me how to plan, build, and maintain a complete application on my own. 
I developed stronger skills in problem-solving, debugging, and managing my time and priorities.This experience helped me build confidence 
in my ability to work in a professional development environment. I now feel well-prepared to continue learning and contributing in either 
a career or graduate program.
