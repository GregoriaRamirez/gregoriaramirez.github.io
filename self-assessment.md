# üìù Self-Assessment

## üéì Program Reflection

I am proud to be completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. Over the course of the program, I progressed from learning how to write basic code to becoming a developer capable of designing and building secure, modular, full-stack applications. Through project-based learning, I gained practical experience with database integration, RESTful APIs, and user interface development using tools like Dash and Flask. I also learned how to apply version control, secure coding practices, and professional documentation standards to deliver real-world software solutions.

While I am still figuring out exactly which path I want to take, I feel confident in the skills I have gained and excited for what comes next. I am especially interested in backend development and working with databases, and I am looking forward to applying these skills in a professional role. At the same time, I plan to keep learning and growing by exploring more advanced topics and continuing to improve as a developer.

## üéØ Course Outcomes and How I Met Them

**1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.**  
_Met through modular code structure, clear documentation, and organized folders to support team understanding._

In my Capstone, I structured the project into separate model, controller, and view files to clearly organize each function. I used descriptive naming conventions and inline comments so any collaborator could pick up where I left off. My README and enhancement documentation explain setup and usage in plain terms, enabling communication across technical skill levels.

---

**2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.**  
_Met through README files, `.md` pages, inline comments, and a narrated video code walkthrough._

My enhancement documentation includes markdown files for each improvement category, a narrated code review video, and multiple screenshots. I ensured consistent formatting, visual hierarchy, and clarity. I avoided overly technical jargon in key summaries to ensure accessibility, while still providing in-depth explanations for technical reviewers.

---

**3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.**  
_Met through refactored filtering logic, modular callback design, and efficient pandas usage._

I optimized filtering logic for breed and color selections using vectorized operations like `.isin()` and `.between()` in pandas. I removed repetitive logic by centralizing callbacks and added conditional branches to handle edge cases. These choices improved efficiency without sacrificing readability or flexibility.

---

**4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.**  
_Met through use of VS Code, MongoDB Compass, Dash, and `.env` for secure, modern development._

I used modern tools such as VS Code, and MongoDB Compass to design a working animal shelter dashboard. I employed `python-dotenv` to load credentials securely, and used Dash for building a responsive data-driven web interface. I also implemented logging and exception handling to create a maintainable and production-ready application.

---

**5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.**  
_Met through `.env` integration, removal of hardcoded credentials, and safe DB connection handling._

I implemented secure MongoDB connection handling using environment variables to avoid credential exposure in code. I ensured the connection was closed properly and wrapped logic in exception handling blocks to prevent unhandled errors. This approach supports long-term application integrity and helps protect sensitive animal shelter data.

## üîÑ Personal Growth

Throughout the CS program and this Capstone, I learned how to take a project from concept to deployment using real development workflows. I strengthened my problem-solving and debugging skills, and I developed a professional approach to security, version control, and application structure. I feel more confident tackling development tasks with industry tools and techniques and am ready to contribute to backend and data-driven software teams.
