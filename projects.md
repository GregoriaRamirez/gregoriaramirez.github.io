## 📌 Purpose

The code review demonstrates how my original Animal Shelter Dashboard project was enhanced for the CS 499 Capstone. I walk through key sections of my original code, explain how I applied enhancements, and show how these changes align with course outcomes across:

- Software Design & Engineering
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Databases
