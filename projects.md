## 🧪 CS 499 Capstone Project Enhancements

This page provides an overview of the three enhancement categories I completed for my CS 499 Capstone project. Each section includes a brief description and a link to the full enhancement write-up.


### 🧩 Software Design & Engineering

Enhanced the project structure by improving modularity, removing hardcoded credentials, and separating callback logic into reusable components for maintainability and scalability.
