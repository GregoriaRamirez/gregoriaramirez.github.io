# 👩‍💻 Welcome to My ePortfolio

Hello, my name is Gregoria Ramirez, and this is my professional ePortfolio for my Computer Science Capstone (CS 499) at Southern New Hampshire University. This site highlights my technical growth, enhanced project work, and my ability to apply software development principles to real-world challenges.

# 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University since June 2022. I graduated in May 2025 with my Associate Degree in Computer Science, with a concentration in Software Engineering, and I am graduating in August 2025 with my Bachelor's degree.

My interest in computer science began with a curiosity about how technology works behind the scenes, from websites and data to the systems that power everyday tools. Over time, this curiosity turned into a passion for solving real-world problems through software development and data-driven solutions. The decision to change careers came from seeing how rapidly technology is evolving and realizing that I wanted to be part of building and improving the systems that shape our future.

Over the course of my degree, I have developed a strong foundation in software development, database management, and full-stack web application design. I am proud of all that I have learned and accomplished throughout my studies, especially through projects like my Animal Shelter Dashboard and my Full Stack Development coursework. These projects taught me how to build secure, modular applications and gave me hands-on experience with real-world workflows, including API integration, user interfaces, and data handling.

With over 25 years of experience in administrative and legal environments, I bring a strong foundation in organization, attention to detail, and client-facing communication to software development. My background supports a practical, structured approach to technical implementation and usability.

I am passionate about writing clean, reusable code and enjoy working with backend systems, databases, and dashboards. I am always eager to learn new tools, expand my technical skills, and contribute to meaningful projects.

I am currently considering pursuing a Master's degree in software systems or data engineering to deepen my knowledge and specialize further. I also plan to keep building my skills in backend development, data visualization, and cloud platforms.

## 🔍 Interests and Strengths

- Software design and modular architecture  
- Backend development with Python and Node.js  
- MongoDB and NoSQL data modeling  
- Creating intuitive user interfaces with Dash and web frameworks  
- Data analysis and interactive dashboards  

## 🎯 Career Goals

I am currently seeking opportunities in:

- Software Engineering  
- Backend or Full-Stack Development  
- Database Administration  
- Systems Integration  
- Data Analytics

## 📁 Capstone Project Overview

**Project Title:** Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard  
**Original Course:** CS 340 – Client-Server Development  
**Enhanced For:** CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone

This dashboard application tracks animal shelter data using a full-stack Python solution. It was originally developed using Jupyter Notebook and MongoDB shell. The project was later refactored using Visual Studio Code and MongoDB Compass for a more organized and professional structure. I modularized the project using Dash, MongoDB, and secure Python scripting. Advanced filtering and data visualizations were also integrated.

## 🚀 Key Enhancements

* Refactored monolithic notebook code into modular Python files  
* Migrated from MongoDB shell to MongoDB Compass for database interaction  
* Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variables  
* Implemented new filters for breed and color  
* Added input validation and improved query logic  
* Visualized shelter outcomes using Dash charts and geolocation
