# 👩‍💻 Welcome to My ePortfolio

Hello, my name is **Gregoria Ramirez**, and this is my professional ePortfolio for my **Computer Science Capstone (CS 499)** at Southern New Hampshire University. This site showcases my technical growth, enhanced project work, and ability to apply software development principles in real-world contexts.

## 📁 Capstone Project Overview

**Project Title:** Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard  
**Original Course:** CS 340 – Client-Server Development  
**Enhanced For:** CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone

This dashboard application helps track animal shelter data using a full-stack Python solution. Originally built in Jupyter Notebook, I refactored the project into a modular and production-ready structure using **MongoDB**, **Dash**, and **secure Python scripting**. I also integrated advanced filtering and visualization features.

## 🚀 Key Enhancements

- ✅ Refactored monolithic notebook code into modular Python files  
- ✅ Migrated from MongoDB shell to MongoDB Compass for database interaction  
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variable support  
- ✅ Implemented new filters for **breed** and **color**  
- ✅ Added input validation and improved query logic  
- ✅ Visualized shelter outcomes using Dash charts and geolocation
