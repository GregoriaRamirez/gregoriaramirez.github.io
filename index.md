# 👩‍💻 Welcome to My ePortfolio

Hello, my name is **Gregoria Ramirez**. This is my ePortfolio for my SNHU CS 499 Capstone to show my project revision skills.

## 📁 CS-499 Capstone: Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard

This project demonstrates my enhanced skills in software design, algorithms and data structures, and database management using a real-world animal shelter dataset. I refactored the original Jupyter Notebook into modular Python files, connected the app to MongoDB Compass using environment variables for security, and added filtering and data visualization using Dash.
