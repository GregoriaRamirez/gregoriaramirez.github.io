# 👩‍💻 Welcome to My ePortfolio

Hello, my name is **Gregoria Ramirez**, and this is my professional ePortfolio for my Computer Science Capstone (CS 499) at Southern New Hampshire University. This site showcases my technical growth, enhanced project work, and ability to apply software development principles in real-world contexts.

## 📁 Capstone Project Overview

**Project Title:** Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard  
**Original Course:** CS 340 – Client-Server Development  
**Enhanced For:** CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone

This dashboard application helps track animal shelter data using a full-stack Python solution. Originally developed using Jupyter Notebook for the interface and the MongoDB shell for database operations. the project was later refactored using Visual Studio Code and MongoDB Compass to make it more organized and professional. I refactored the project into a modular and production-ready structure using MongoDB, Dash, and secure Python scripting. I also integrated advanced filtering and visualization features.

## 🚀 Key Enhancements

- ✅ Refactored monolithic notebook code into modular Python files  
- ✅ Migrated from MongoDB shell to MongoDB Compass for database interaction  
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variable support  
- ✅ Implemented new filters for breed and color  
- ✅ Added input validation and improved query logic  
- ✅ Visualized shelter outcomes using Dash charts and geolocation
