# üìù Self-Assessment

## üéì Program Reflection

I am proud to be completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. Over the course of the program, 
I have grown from writing basic code into a developer capable of creating secure, modular, full-stack applications.

Through hands-on projects, I gained experience working with databases, APIs, and user interfaces, applying real-world development practices every step of the way.

## üß† Skills Gained

- Clean, modular software design using the MVC pattern
- Data filtering, manipulation, and validation using pandas
- Backend development and CRUD operations with Python and MongoDB
- Secure configuration using environment variables and `python-dotenv`
- Real-time dashboard creation using Dash and Plotly
- Debugging and logging for error tracking and maintainability
- Managing dependencies with `venv` and `requirements.txt`

## ‚úÖ Program Outcomes Met

**Outcome 1:**  
Organized project files into a modular structure so others can easily understand and extend the code.

**Outcome 2:**  
Documented the code with inline comments and created a detailed walkthrough video explaining all enhancements.

**Outcome 3:**  
Applied software engineering practices such as logging, MVC design, and secure credential storage.

**Outcome 4:**  
Improved filtering logic with optimized control flows and added input validation for user inputs.

**Outcome 5:**  
Refactored data access to use real-time MongoDB queries, improved database handling, and ensured secure connections.

## üîÑ Personal Growth

Working independently on my Capstone project taught me how to plan, build, and maintain a complete application on my own. 
I developed stronger skills in problem-solving, debugging, and managing my time and priorities.

This experience helped me build confidence in my ability to work in a professional development environment. I now feel well-prepared to continue learning and contributing in either a career or graduate program.
