# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hello! My name is **Gregoria Ramirez**, and I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University Since June 2022.
I graduated in May 2025 with my Associate in Computer Science Concentration Software Engeneering and graduating in August 2025 with my Bachelors. 
Over the course of my degree, I have developed a strong foundation in software development, database management, and full-stack web application design.

I am passionate about solving real-world problems using technology and take pride in writing clean, modular, and efficient code. 
My recent work includes enhancing an Animal Shelter Dashboard using Python, Dash, and MongoDB — a project that showcases my skills in secure coding, data visualization, and application design.

## 🔍 Interests and Strengths

- Software design and modular architecture
- Backend development with Python and Node.js
- MongoDB and NoSQL data modeling

## 🎯 Career Goals

I am currently seeking opportunities in:
 
- Software Engineer
- Backend or full-stack development
- Database administration
- Systems integration
- Data Analytics

I am also considering pursueing my Masters to further specialize in software systems or data engineering.
